To clean up Vite from your CRA React project, follow these steps:

1. Delete these files if they exist in your frontend directory:
   - vite.config.ts
   - index.html (if not CRA's public/index.html)
   - tsconfig.node.json

2. Remove Vite-related dependencies:
   Run in your frontend directory:
   npm uninstall vite @vitejs/plugin-react-swc

3. Make sure your package.json scripts use CRA commands:
   - "start": "react-scripts start"
   - "build": "react-scripts build"
   - "test": "react-scripts test"

4. Remove any .env or config files referencing Vite-specific settings.

5. Start your app with:
   npm start

Your project will now be a clean Create React App setup.
